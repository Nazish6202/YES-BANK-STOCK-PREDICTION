    "Yes Bank has experienced extreme volatility in its stock price over the last 15+ years, moving from a small private bank to a high‑growth lender, then suffering a severe loss of investor confidence around 2018–2020 following asset quality issues and governance concerns. This project analyses monthly Yes Bank stock prices from July 2005 to November 2020 using classical machine learning regression models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main objectives are:\n",
    "- To perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the OHLC (Open, High, Low, Close) time‑series.\n",
    "- To engineer features that capture trends, volatility and short‑term momentum.\n",
    "- To build and compare multiple regression models that predict the next month’s closing price.\n",
    "- To interpret the business impact of model performance and key features.\n",
    "\n",
    "We first clean and sort the dataset, convert the Date column to proper datetime type and create new features such as High–Low spread, monthly returns, moving average of Close (MA_3) and 5‑month rolling volatility based on returns. Then we conduct structured visualization with at least 15 charts, including univariate, bivariate and multivariate analysis: line plots of Close, distributions of OHLC values, correlation heatmap, moving averages, return distributions and volatility patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the modelling phase, we formulate a regression problem: predict the next month’s closing price (Target) from the current month’s engineered features. We implement three models: Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor and Gradient Boosting Regressor. We train on the earlier years and test on recent years (time‑based split) using RMSE and MAE as primary evaluation metrics. Hyperparameter tuning is carried out for the tree‑based models using GridSearchCV. We analyse whether the tuned models provide measurable improvements over baseline models.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results show that simple Linear Regression is unable to capture the non‑linear patterns and regime shifts in the stock. Tree‑based ensemble models (Random Forest and Gradient Boosting) perform better, with Gradient Boosting generally achieving the lowest RMSE and MAE on the test set. Feature importance analysis shows that current Close, High, Low and the short‑term moving average (MA_3) contribute most to predictions, while volatility and returns act as secondary signals.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a business perspective, these models can help investors and risk managers estimate the plausible range of next‑month prices, supporting decision‑making for entry/exit timing and portfolio risk management. However, given the high volatility, structural breaks and non‑stationary nature of financial markets, the predictions should be used as supportive tools rather than exact forecasts. Further improvements are possible by incorporating more granular data (daily prices, volumes, macroeconomic factors, and bank‑specific news) and advanced time‑series models (LSTM, Prophet, etc.)."
